group forecast decline slightly 2018  we anticipate special charges form integration costs connection agreed acquisitions  we aim earn significant premium cost capital 2018  however  compared previous year  basf group  ebit cost capital decrease considerably  this mainly due lower ebit  including m  arelated special charges  well additional cost capital planned acquisitions  we planning total

currently planned investments next five years forecast around 35 billion euros  if merger oil  gas activities dea consummated intended  capital expenditures longer reported investments basf  the next slide summarizes outlook 2018 ebit special items segment  as described previously  ebit special items basf group expected slightly 2017 level  this mainly driven significantly higher contributions performance products  functional materials  solutions oil  gas segments  we forecasting slight improvement earnings generated other  after extraordinary result 2017  expect considerably lower ebit

launched grow special items segment slightly  additional information available stefanie already said annual reports 2017 also published today  and  happy take questions  ladies gentlemen  i would like open call questions   operator instructions   and start andrew stott ubs  please go ahead  andrew  yeah good morning  stefanie good morning hans  thanks questions  so couple  first  start 2018  said circle complex year  i guess s also complex got outages  citral also enchanting mdi  and i think one two smaller ones  at stage  give idea perhaps ebit impact  and also  thinking insurance proceeds  and indeed  q4 performance products sit   thank  the second one coming back guidance ag year  do i take re sort assuming rather booking 9 months  re probably going book closer 6 months  really integration costs going fairly material  i nt quite sure assumption within  thank  yeah  hi andrew  thanks questions  i take first one hans second one integration cost  2018 yes   little bit complex also due outages i mentioned speech  external effects control one obviously  and clearly magnitudes unexpected s shortage natural gas enchanting operating speak  certainly doubledigit ebit impact  quite clearly  hopefully back late february early march needs seen  then freezing temperatures earlier year q4 us gulf coast  also supplier side issues impaired production volumes  and doubledigit impact  volume growth overall january good planned  it s early talk february still couple days go  as know businesses  volumes come rather late final days months  sales booked  so  s bit uncertainty  however  look underlying economic drivers  underlying growth regions  businesses customers still positive outlook  and i think justifies intention slightly improve last year s earnings  performance  products specifically citral   insurance payment received q4 early talk q1  actually  extremely busy reinstalling capacity  the reason situation relatively small incident fire however impacted cabling citral  indiscernible  entire plant  as follow way follow reburied  ph  detail internet daily reburied  ph  progress making certainly aware customers quite concerned situation utmost provide much product possible also coming quantin malaysia  indiscernible  citral related products  impacted also bottom line q1 integration cost  i got question correctly  it guidance  giving agricultural solution segment   happening result point time expect acquire business  season already behind us  so  words experience year 2018 predominantly cost much revenue income result  key driver expect see slight decline earnings agricultural solutions business versus slight increase would seen without acquisition  hope helps  the next question comes paul walsh  morgan stanley  sorry  actually alice call paul  so two questions   mind  the first question could explain decided bigger dividend given eps growth achieved second question regards fy  18 forecast statement  what assumptions behind consumables increase chemicals ebit fy  18  thank  yeah  thanks questions  forecast chemicals segment  clearly  earnings margin improvements 2017 way i would describe normal cyclicality supply demand driven especially isocyanate  simply believe going repeat 2018  would great  ph  case today  point view likelihood staying low last year higher likelihood stay last year  much higher actually  and know considerable decrease means 10  certainly possible giving high level earnings segment  dividend  obviously discuss internally quite bit  change steps something like  010 20  even people said know could approximately final year say goodbye ways good bye big dividend increase  obviously happening  we clear policy place say want increase dividend yearoveryear predictable way done one exception right financial crisis 2009 i think fully understood  we payout ratio refer 50  take yardstick really  we also years payout ratio 75   so  us  steady stage  predictable cash return improvement importance  seeing something continue  whether board decided future change steps increase magnitude needs seen  2017  felt right thing  and tony jones redburn  please go ahead  tony  line  obviously  anymore might queue  then move onto laurence alexander jeffries  please go ahead  good morning  i guess two questions  first  shift oil  gas segment jv  opportunity transfer leverage jv anticipate balance sheet evolution basf  and secondly chemicals business  anticipate mediumterm margins returning levels saw earlier decade  think rather new level 2017 sustainable  hi  laurence  talk chemicals business  mean  chemicals segment  cyclical yes  the chemicals segment  yes  yes    stream business  okay  very good question  it new normal stay  i mean   underlying improvement business  i think  costs well control  supply  demand healthy markets growing time  yes   new capacity markets coming stream  cyclicality disappear volatility disappear  i doubt  i think  still see swings earnings margins  i  know yet  whether go back  let  say difficult levels point time  necessarily  we exited couple businesses felt uncomfortable know  we maintained businesses like isocyanates think good market position  good technology good cost position acrylic assets give another example  excellent cost position  see room improvement 2018  so  really go product product demand chemical cycle   really product wise specific  so  products might go  margins go  might come  on average believe chemicals  segment  margins likely come bit  certainly level described  and oil  gas leverage jointventure  also consequently basf group  yeah  laurence  thanks question  now let  go back  quickly kurt said earlier transaction  currently going confirmatory due diligence  we started discussion letterone financing jointventure  would premature answer question whether  potential transfer leverage jointventure company  it certainly finance expect us also letterone way company competitive  positioned growth financed accordingly  what means basf s p  l  kurt explained already  it point signing  shown discontinued operation  so separate line  sales  separate line net profit line  and point time close according s discussed far  consolidated equity  so  assets debt show point time replaced financial participation basf joint venture  okay move stephanie bothwell bank america merrill lynch  yes  thank much thanks opportunity ask two questions  so firstly  new projects  from acquisition ve made  could walk us projects expected contribute positively ebit 2018  and linked earlier question oil  gas  update us capex guide 20182019 whether expect significant deviation given oil  gas transaction  stephanie  35 billion 5year period probably divide 5 come large number 2018 maybe slightly higher needs seen  but  important context signing transaction agreement  numbers include anymore basf group s counts  it s still  still cash relevant  hans said  joint venture supposed standalone financed entity able capable find growth trajectory  new projects  couple new capacities coming stream  one  i already mentioned   indiscernible  trial investment obviously  going higher gear 2018  we also completed ndi investment joint venture shanghai  also contribute sales cash flow hopefully also earnings given level margin business  we couple smaller startups somewhat i mentioned presentation especially automotive industry  so  want continue grow business organically  and i think 2017 shown paying captured growth especially asia especially china made couple investments  major investments years  going continue provide growth basf going forward  i hope answers question  so s andreas heine mainfirst  please go ahead  yes  i  first  i d like ask question outlook  so  said team ebit reported ebit  is fair assume seeing difference two numbers look point increase range 0 5  rather upper half  and secondly also related outlook  look said acquisition impact might 2018 ebit acquisitions agro negative significant net two acquisitions rather loss positive contribution  is outlook maybe give also update ramp quantin whole complex far i know big lutic one change tight market citral plant could rent quickly  thank  andreas i would take second question hans would try come conclusion say first one little bit complex answer  quantin  yes  ramp mode  this working quite nicely  site plants comparable  correct  obviously  see incident lutic  half  change plans tracks essentially ship everything quickly possible europe fill pipeline year make sure customers get much product possible  meaning subsequent steps quintin delayed slightly  then see restart citral end march  early april i hope things go back normal quickly possible  and hans give specifics outlook  i fully understand andreas  i think  simply speak guidance gave  andreas  important understand compare ebit  17 outlook giving  18  please keep mind considerable amount positive special items  overall total 194 million year 2017 result divestitures also result reversing impairments oil fields norway netherlands 2016 i recall correctly  so  important keep mind  and yes result acquisitions  built outlook ie  acquisition bio assets well solvey  we  worked i would call preliminary integration figures due status two transactions understand disclose anything overall leads difference guidance duly noted ebit special items ebit  and let add andreas certainly try give detail call early may  may 05th  we hope know much  what important see business definition extremely seasonal  i mean major chunk business done q1  closing q1 obviously  sales earnings essentially get cost reminder year  this later reflected purchase price adjustment  obviously impacts also  closing date really impact forecast reason  made specific talking  what currently see likely timeline  the next question  logan farmer   ph   evercore  hi  yes  good afternoon  everybody  two questions please  the first one capital allocation talked i guess bit today dividend  you  guiding capex flat next five years  earnings least next year  mention oil  gas potential deleveraging  so  i  wondering  given   happened dividend  could consider complementing progressive dividend buyback  i think past said given without headroom proper one  could consider buyback given underleverage balance sheet  and second question nanjing ypc jv  looks like  got dividend 200 million euros  well deleveraging  expect nanjing become source dividend stream  ph  expect point time  plus significant investments  thanks  logan  two questions  nanjing  yes  good results  it  5050 jointventure know order magnitude 230 million 240 million euros earnings  it obviously also decision whether want keep money country pay dividend relates second part question major investments  foreseen  invested bit last couple years nanjing  fairly discussion ongoing discussion sinopec whether could done  one startup coming 2020 neopentylglycol one startup 2019 propionic acid  so  couple things still going nanjing  overall  pretty satisfied development jointventure sinopec  capital allocation general  i mean  know priorities  want grow company profitable way  earning premium cost capital   always said buybacks financed via additional debt really want  i know  kind fashion  united states   deem really intelligen
 strategy basf  there  really lot ifs question  deleveraging due oil  gas  continued vertically low investment level depreciation continued good business development  might become cash rich think i would surprised  i would surprised management basf  take interest account  talking buybacks   also interesting  get different feedback investors quite clearly  some like clearly dislike  so  unified opinion buybacks really greater thing earth  but  ifs work described i think good problem solved  the next question peter clark  societe generale  please go ahead  yes  good afternoon thank  two questions  investment fiveyear outlook 19 billion obviously oil  gas little less last year  but infrastructure r  ds  i m wondering push r  d allocated yet  and second question h  a question  performance products regarding considerable increase ebit year  i mean s always proved challenging segments forecast  if raw materials stay pretty much  think catch margins squeeze whereas ve terms pricing also work due cost base  it something envision second half year  really need raw material pressure alleviate  thank  thanks peter questions  i ll leave capex question hans try answer performance question  first  clearly see need improve margin blindly put  i mean satisfied development 2017  obviously citral another curve ball expect last question  the currency effect frankly quite negative q4 likely going continue going 2018  what seen raw materialmarginsales price front slight improvement meaning margin squeeze diminished coming almost passing  raw material price increases customers  but nt yet seen full expect totally complete year 2017 effect still quite negative  we put couple price increases overall effect also january 1  even cases might suffer bit volume setback  said point time almost across ball increase prices given raw material cost position underlying demand patterns markets  we couple businesses frankly  essentially supply demand driven performance also demand driven products  price adjustment feasible  others implement i would surprised nt payoff going q1 q2  but clearly uphill battle frankly benefit i d say taking long expected year goal  but please keep mind raw material cost oil price increase relatively strongly late last year  yeah  peter  with respect question capex  19 billion hardly anything capex research development  that almost exclusively expensed r  d expense order magnitude let s say around 2 billion per year  expect increase bit result bayer acquisition business requires support research development  please keep mind quarter entire research development budget bsf group allocated exsolutions business increase bit result bayer acquisition capex hardly anything r  d  so patrick raymond james  please go ahead  good afternoon  thanks taking two questions  the first one related tax impact us  i think gave us 2017 noncash impact could help us tax rate impacts actually cash flow impact tax reform  especially post oil  gas accounting changes  the second question calculation cash flow oil  gas make sure whether i  right math  i find 650 million correct number    thanks  i start second part second question patrick  that figure right  respect free cash flow 90 million short  round figures  1200 million short  the tax impact us   provided noncash impact 2017  roughly 400 million  i think exact figure 379 million 2017  now give figure going forward  i tax experts  tell clearly corporate tax rate goes 14 percentage points changes assumptions need make  makes extremely difficult  our guidance respect tax rate bsf group would mid20s way past oil  gas trade bit roll would expect higher earnings result typically aim higher governance corporate government takes higher taxation  as result mid20s probably good figure use run calculations  it still including oil  gas forecast  that still includes oil  gas mentioned kurt earlier would expect transaction close earlier towards end q3  thank  the next question  indiscernible  please go ahead  hello thank taking questions  i two please  may bit earlier say guidance potential impact moving oil  gas group tax rate andor returns profile terms returns capital employed  and second question relating capex projects  going start construction cathode materials facility europe year  thank  first question second question  i try answer  this joint effort know  sitting  indiscernible  secure supply cobalt instrumental success entity midst planning digital engineering phase  so  stay tuned  yeah  now tax rate without oil  gas  i  sorry  sebastian  i need far prior answer  simply difficult predict number assumptions  make oil price  gas price  earnings like  i think best say point time general guidance  giving mid20s tax rate basf group  oil  gas asset heavy business  look annual report  see asset base oil  gas  order magnitude 13 billion euros   calculation anymore returns  that improve return profile example return capital employed basis overall  the next question chetan udeshi  jpmorgan  please go ahead  yeah  hi  thanks  i question margin performance products functional materials segments  look yearonyear decline margin  i mean yearonyear decline margin  segments much higher actually saw past three quarters  so  i mean  i  sure seeing impact price increases initiated right 2017 two segments  that  number one  and  think q1  q2  like said response earlier question  q1  q2 see improvement  so  say improvement  looking margins beginning go yearonyear like reducing pace decline two businesses  that  number one point  and number two point number two question rather  maybe perception moment  maybe give color  basf unlucky last 12 months 18 months terms number production issues  seen different plants think statistical perspective  nothing much different past  thank  sorry  thanks questions  chetan  i think i  tried explain performance products functional materials  solutions  margin pressure continued yet  yes   able increase prices  increasingly negative impact quarter  sequentially quarteronquarter come quite significantly  if trajectory continues q1 q2 see positive rebound happening  what hit us i mentioned well q4 really currency effect quite negative actually first time 2017  and continues going 2018  but purely raw material cost price increases yes  i could use word pace decline come come quite dramatically  and i said also announced implemented couple price increases early 2018  helped respect  production issues given size basf always something works perfectly also always something nt really work planned  we look  carefully call unplanned outages  and obviously q4 number come quite bit  and i mentioned reason external factors weather related going also q1  supplier related one issue really citral  internal internal issue startup phase  that order magnitude number incidents  normal i would say quite unlikely combination weather raw material related issues q4  q1  what never frankly  china frankly  told nt expect natural gas supply full stop next couple months nt even argue  that new experience obviously also beyond control  we another question  indiscernible    operator instructions   thank  thank much  again  capex  maybe indicate capex maintenance capex versus past  this first question  and last question citral  i still struggling least stage  prebuying related products like vitamins times margins significantly  can indicate underlying margins including negative share effect  thank  yeah thanks question  i nt numbers tip finger regard underlying margins  i nt think provide  and way regard capex  our capex large maintenance related  for instance  germany  capitalize maintenance cost expense goes directly p  l  and numbers  maintenance spending bafs come yearoveryear  so  keep high level  also reflecting talked regard asset availability called internally asset effectiveness run plants  yes  probably i say capex spending  a good chunk actually growth driven  another chunk eh  s related always major piece spending maintenance related s really growth driven  okay  so  one final follow question  logan farmer   ph  evercore  so  pressure  really small one  in capex guidance next five years  r  d infrastructure line gone 1 billion euros since 2016 report  i wondering whether related battery investment billion quite significant  thank  as always five years plans  almost 100  certainty  coming year one  you 60  certainty commitment year two numbers significantly declining  so  could also addressed infrastructure r  d simply yet 100  specified  okay

1,should farmers be bullish or bearish on beans  ohio ag net  ohios country journal, there often conflicting information trades whether farmers bullish bearish  usually reasons  therefore  i often write reasons market could go developing marketing strategy  i use information determine i think likely i make best trades possible given information i know time   seasonally south american weather market approaching end  us carryout highest 10 years  still increasing due slow exports  world stocks still high levels   1020 beans better returns  4 corn average us farmer leading speculation increasing us farmers plant beans 2018  a possible trade war either mexico china     dry conditions southern us plains  world stocks  high  starting descend  on 2919 i sold balance 2018 bean production aug  1007  making overall average  1010 aug futures  why aug instead nov  august trading 5 cents higher nov  i also think us carryout continue stay 10year high  if happens  carry market  nearby month lower future month   if happens  i roll aug positions back nov could add extra 15cent profit trades  meaning possible  1025 nov eventually  what spread risk  while type trade worked well past   obviously guaranteed  my risk major production issue argentina forcing largescale reductions  would decrease overall world us carryout  this happened 2016  trade like year would 40cent loss  so similar situation happened year  would mean current  1010 average could go  970  how likely argentina production issues  it  uncertain forecasts vary daily  a week ago less likely  dryness became widespread  the original usda estimates expected brazil produce 112 mmt  million metric tons  argentina 54 mmt  totaling 166 mmt combined  with favorable weather conditions brazil  poor conditions argentina estimates generally ranging 158 to168 mmt  one mmt 40 million bushels beans  current usda carryout estimates show 540 million bushels end marketing year  assuming world demand remains  reduction 3 mmt would likely minimal effect market  8 mmt less production could significant impact prices  why sell 100  2018 production  honestly  question i  wrestling last weeks  there three big reasons  1  likely bean acre increases  i think  likely farmers increase bean acres 2018  many estimates suggest increases 15 3 million acres 2017  at higher levels  weather scare would needed us summer prevent lower prices  2  south america conditions  the 2018 argentina bean crop one rain event away significantly large  this could hurt exports us crop forcing larger carryout  a supply disruption south america really necessary significant price increase point  3  guaranteed profitability  i know beans profitable corn  i want lock prices  are concerned 100  priced early  yes  like farmers i sell i  concerned i made wrong decision prices go  but  i limit farm operation risk selling beans  i reduce risk exposure take guaranteed bean profits  basically i sold today i  more worried rain argentina bean prices plummet  i missing top market  i also think another way  i still 50  2017 corn crop 75  2018 corn crop unpriced  if beans rally   likely pull corn prices  for instance beans increase  2 per bushel   reasonable assume corn would increase 40 cents also keep price ratio relatively close  since corn market price currently breakeven points corn  40cent corn rally would needed take profitable levels  on average farmers produce corn beans  produce three times corn beans  this ratio varies across midwest   four times farm    good rule thumb  the price ratio futures usually falls line production ratio 22 30  currently  25   so  beans hit  12 corn would likely adjust  4 maybe even  450  why use options participate big rally comes  i thought  i considered buying  10 puts 50 cents take advantage rally  i math   make sense  if i i would receive guaranteed  950 unlimited upside potential  ie  hoping higher prices   but even prices increase  11  i still subtract cost call  50 cents   meaning i would get  1050  this slightly better  10  prices  go  11  guarantee  i  sure even likely   i  stuck  950  i also considered buying  11 call 20 cents i sold beans take advantage potential future market rally  i thought odds low prices would surpass  1120  would needed warrant spending 20 cents call cost needs subtracted i sold would placed  990 guarantee  i  think odds enough favor  while i always consider buying options marketing strategy  i try avoid trades i hope prices go higher make profit i usually end losing  even without unpredictable weather events  many unknowns market  i became concerned seeing milo  sorghum  basis drop 70 cents day china announced looking us trade policies  china world  largest bean buyer  always possibility market manipulation  realistically   probably long shot china would want put tariff beans given growth potential protein consumption   difficult know view trade products metals finished goods could target us administration trade policy  the market rallied little  disappointed sold  sure  hindsight i wish i would waited little pick extra 25 cents  i way knowing would happen  it could easily gone amount  i remember week last july i  sell corn looked like weather would dry prices rally  i wish i would sold corn friday july widespread rain happened prices never recovered  it  extremely difficult know right time sell  there always reasons prices go higher reasons go lower  on top  weather unpredictable  hence corn bean prices unpredictable  i  control  i focus time i control  in case   i always crop sell  if i know breakeven points  i know price i need sell grain  figure hit profitable price point using marketing strategies available  it  pointless dwell beat i  hit top market  no one every
